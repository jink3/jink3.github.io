Product: ThetaCore Connect
Company: ThetaCore
Brief: I designed the entire app's product from the Sign Up screens to main features and product pages in the app. It's a mobile first design approach for iOS and Android native apps, with a responsive web app for browsers. Working closely with the dev team, I heavily utilized a customized Vuetify library and designed the entire brand Style Guide as well as the Design Component Library using Figma. We launched the app to hundreds of users, and will expand to thousands of users by mid year.

Brief: As the sole and first designer for Hepta I was tasked with creating the whole design process from the start, creating a Style Guide & Component Library using Sketch. The product was a B2B SaaS web app, and I worked with the devs to customize Material UI react components to create landing pages and dashboards containing a multitude of data visualizations such as charts, graphs, gauges, tables, etc. We successfully launched the redesigned web app tp be used by thousands of users for several clients.
